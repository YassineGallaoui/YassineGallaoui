# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yassine, a Full stack web developer, highly specialized on Frontend. In my free time I like to also work on little Mobile projects, also using cross platform technologies like React Native.  
I worked as Frontend Developer for a digital agency based in Mendrisio (Switzerland) for approximately 1 year and then, from February 2022, as Full Stack developer for Deloitte in Milan (Italy).  
When I am not working you could find me coding side projects, reading, drawing, randomly surfing the internet, watching or playing football or, rarely, playing videogames.
