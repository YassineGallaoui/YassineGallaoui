# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yassine, an Italian-Tunisian Software Engineer, highly specialized on Frontend development with ~4 years on the field.  
After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I worked as Frontend Developer for a digital agency based in Mendrisio (Switzerland) for approximately 1 year.  
Then, from February 2022 till December 2024, I worked as Full Stack developer for Deloitte, in Milan, Italy.  

When I am not working probably you will find me coding side projects, reading, randomly surfing the internet, watching or playing football or videogames.
